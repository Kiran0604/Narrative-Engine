The upcoming advancements for those with disabilities are life-changing</p><p>Washing machines liberated women to get soul-crushing jobs that ate up their free time. Social media gave the world one revolution – before it destabilised democracies everywhere else. Now AI is here, and its main job seems to be replacing screenwriters. It’s easy to fall into techno-pessimism, but new documentary Seeing into the Future (Sunday 23 November, 8pm, BBC Two) has a different angle. For disabled people, tech has already brought about life-changing advancements. And we haven’t seen anything yet.</p><p>It is presented by comedian and Strictly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/dec/14/its-chris-and-diannes-time-to-shine-as-winners-of-strictlys-glitterball\">winner</a> Chris McCausland, who is blind. Some of the most casually astonishing scenes occur early on, showing how he uses his phone – essentially, an eye with a mouth. “What T-shirt is this?” he asks, holding up a garment. “A&nbsp;grey T-shirt with a graphic logo of Deftones,” his phone obliges. It can even tell him if the shirt needs ironing. But it’s where all this is going that fascinates McCausland, so he heads to the US, to see what’s in development at the houses of our tech overlords.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/nov/22/chris-mccausland-seeing-into-the-future-tech-changing-disabled-peoples-lives-bbc\">Continue reading...</a>",

    "description": "<p>In this week’s newsletter: When the video-sharing site launched in 2005, there were fears it would replace terrestrial television. It didn’t just replace it – it invented entirely new forms of content.

Sign up here</strong></a></p><p>Barely a month goes by without <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/30/youtube-tv-destination-children-ofcom-survey\">more news</a> of streaming sites overtaking traditional, terrestrial TV. Predominant among those sits YouTube, with more than <a href=\"https://www.globalmediainsight.com/blog/youtube-users-statistics/\">2.5 billion monthly viewers</a>. For people my age – a sprightly 28 – and younger, YouTube is less of an app or website than our answer to radio: the ever-present background hum of modern life. While my mum might leave Radio 4 wittering or BBC News flickering in the corner as she potters about the house, I’ve got a video essay about Japan’s unique approach to urban planning playing on my phone. That’s not to say I never watch more traditional TV (although 99% of the time I’m accessing it through some other kind of subscription streaming app), but when I get home after a long day and the thought of ploughing through another hour of grim prestige fare feels too demanding, I’m probably watching YouTube. Which means it’s very unlikely that I’m watching the same thing as you.</p><p>When Google paid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/oct/09/digitalmedia.googlethemedia\">$1.65bn for the platform in 2006</a>, (just 18 months after it launched) the price seemed astronomical. Critics questioned whether that valuation could be justified for any video platform. The logic was simple – unless YouTube could replace television, it would never be worth it. Nearly two decades on, that framing undersells what actually happened. YouTube didn’t just replace television – it invented entirely new forms of content: vodcasts, vlogs, video essays, reaction videos, ASMR and its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/shortcuts/2018/nov/05/mukbang-is-loneliness-behind-the-craze-for-watching-other-people-eating\">heinous cousin mukbang</a>. The platform absorbed new trends and formats at lightning speed, building what became an alternative “online mainstream”. Before podcasters, TikTokers, Substackers and even influencers, there were YouTubers.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/21/has-tv-gone-down-the-youtube-how-the-platform-changed-how-we-consume-and-create-media\">Continue reading...</a>",
